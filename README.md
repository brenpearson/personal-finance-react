## Personal Finance Dashboard

A small journey into learning React and Typescript.

## Getting Started

This project has both a frontend and backend that you will have to run.

First for the backend you will need to install Python 3 and Flask. Assuming you have Python and pip installed you can just run `pip install flask`.
Now you can run the server by running
### `python backend/backend.py`

Now that the backend is running we can set up the frontend React app in another terminal tab.
In order to run the app you will first need to get the dependencies by running
### `npm install`

<br />After this is finished you can simply run
### `npm start`

Which runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.<br />

## Improvements
As this was a short project I did not get time to do everything I would like to do so here a few things I would improve given more time.<br />
<ul>
  <li><b>Testing</b> - There is not any testing on this project at the moment, I spent a bit much time diving into how React works and getting better at it, I would love to add some testing to this and learn those processes as well. Things like the API would be a no brainer for unit tests and also the client side in React with the API models</li>
  <li><b>Responsive</b> - I started to get to know a little about the responsive adaptive UI to make for easy viewing on mobile, but did not get enough time to really dive into that part yet too much. I want to learn more about making Web UI adapt to mobile and desktop seamlessly.</li>
  <li><b>More/better data</b> - As this was just a small project, the data that I was passing from the API was pretty simple and I did not have to do much on the client side to display it, would be really interesting to have a huge list of transactions and calculate all the graphics manually. I tried to show what that might look like without manually typing out a mountain of data. Also PS. obviously a real database would go a long way ;)</li>
</ul>
